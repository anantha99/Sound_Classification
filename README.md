# Sound_Classification

This repository contains different projects on sound classification.

The Urban Sound Classification Folder is a classification project for the [UrbanSound8K](https://urbansounddataset.weebly.com/urbansound8k.html) dataset.

This dataset contains **8732 labeled sound excerpts** (<=4seconds) of urban sounds from **10 classes**: air_conditioner, car_horn, children_playing, dog_bark, drilling, enginge_idling, gun_shot, jackhammer, siren, and street_music. The classes are drawn from the urban sound taxonomy.

The file consists of a audio file and metadata file.
#### The Audio File 
8732 audio files of urban sounds in WAV format. The sampling rate, bit depth, and number of channels are the same as those of the original file uploaded to Freesound (and hence may vary from file to file).

#### The metadata file 
This file contains meta-data information about every audio file in the dataset. The details maybe found [here](https://urbansounddataset.weebly.com/urbansound8k.html)
